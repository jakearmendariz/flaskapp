Created a flask app with MongoDb, the html,css is actually my personal website, but that was just for fun. I added user login, signup, password encryption, file upload and storage using gridfs. Feel free to use the python files for anything you want. 

Also in tweet.py I added a feature that uses the tweepy api to make a request of tweets, then I used a sediment analyzer: Textblah to be able to give the twitters population current view on a specific word, check it out
